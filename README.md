# Palindrome Birthday Checker ðŸŽ‚

Welcome to the Palindrome Birthday Checker project! This JavaScript application allows you to check if your birthdate is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) in various date formats. It's a fun way to explore coding concepts and celebrate unique dates!

## Features

- **Palindrome Check:** Determine if your birthdate is a palindrome across multiple date formats.
- **Next Palindrome Date:** Find the next palindrome date after your birthdate along with the days in between.
- **Interactive UI:** Easy-to-use interface for entering and discovering palindrome birthdays.

## How to Use

1. Enter your birthdate in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. If your birthdate is a palindrome, celebrate with confetti! ðŸ¥³
4. If not, discover the next palindrome date and the days in between.
